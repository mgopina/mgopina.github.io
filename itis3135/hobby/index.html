                    Cooking is the process of combining ingredients and applying heat (or cold) to transform them 
                    into a finished dish. The basics involve understanding different food groups—proteins, 
                    carbohydrates, and fats—and how they interact with seasonings and cooking methods. 
                    Techniques like sautéing, boiling, baking, and grilling each bring out different flavors and 
                    textures. The key is to balance ingredients, cook at the right temperatures, and taste as you go
                    to adjust seasoning. With practice, cooking becomes an intuitive and rewarding skill that allows
                    for both creativity and nourishment.

                Cooking is like a little magic show in my kitchen—except instead of pulling rabbits out of hats, I
                turn a bunch of random ingredients into something delicious (most of the time). I love the
                creativity of mixing flavors, the satisfying sizzle of a hot pan, and the joy of sharing a meal with
                others. Plus, there’s something oddly rewarding about conquering a tricky recipe—like defeating 
                a mini-boss in a video game, but with way better snacks at the end!

                Seasonal recipes celebrate the freshest ingredients available at different times of the year, 
                making the most of their peak flavor and nutritional value. In the spring, dishes often highlight 
                fresh greens, asparagus, and citrus, while summer recipes feature vibrant berries, tomatoes, 
                and grilled vegetables. Fall brings warm, comforting meals with squash, apples, and hearty
                spices, whereas winter recipes focus on root vegetables, citrus, and slow-cooked dishes. 
                Cooking with seasonal ingredients not only enhances the taste of a dish but also supports local
                farmers and encourages a sustainable approach to food.
            </p>

                  healthier eating, but it also brings a sense of accomplishment and creativity. Whether you’re following a recipe or
                experimenting with flavors, each meal is a chance to improve and enjoy the process. With practice, patience, and a

                Cooking isn’t just about feeding yourself—it’s a skill that brings a whole range of benefits, both 
                practical and enjoyable. First, it saves money; homemade meals are almost always cheaper 
                than takeout or dining out. It also gives you control over what goes into your food, making it 
                easier to eat healthier or indulge in your favorite comfort dishes without guilt. Beyond that, 
                cooking can be a creative outlet, allowing you to experiment with flavors, try new techniques, 
                and even invent your own recipes. It’s also a great way to de-stress—there’s something calming 
                about chopping vegetables or stirring a simmering pot. And let’s not forget the social perks: 
                cooking for friends and family can bring people together, turning a simple meal into a shared 
                experience. Plus, mastering a few impressive dishes is a surefire way to impress guests. At the 
                end of the day, whether you’re making a quick weekday dinner or tackling a gourmet challenge, 
                cooking is a skill worth having—because everyone loves a good homemade meal!

                    JS that hides all sections except the one you have clicked. The idea is to mimic the nav bar in your main site,
                     the user will click a "link" in your nav tag that will hide all the sections on the page and ONLY display info
                      of the section of choice. So if you click on the word "Best locations" in the nav bar, it will only display the
                       "best locations" section on the page and hide the rest so the user can't scroll to see it.
