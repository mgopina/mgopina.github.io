            <h3>Well-done website: <a href="https://andpizza.com/" target="_blank">&#38;pizza</a></h3>
            <p>
                &pizza’s website is a modern, visually engaging platform with a sleek black-and-white 
                aesthetic, bold typography, and high-quality images. It features a clean layout with 
                intuitive navigation, making it easy for users to explore the menu, find locations, 
                and place orders. The site effectively balances style and functionality, creating a 
                seamless and enjoyable user experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Contrast is used effectively, bold typography stands out, dark on light color scheme emphasizes words.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Consistent theme throughout the site, same fonts, colors, and buttons are used.</li>
                <li>Alignment: sections, text, and images are organized in a structured way. Intuitive and easy to follow.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Related elements are grouped logically, use of white space avoides clutter.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Terrible website: <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>
                Yale School of Art’s website is an unstructured, text-heavy page with minimal visual hierarchy
                and an outdated design. The lack of alignment, inconsistent typography, and scattered content 
                make navigation confusing. While it reflects an experimental and artistic approach, it 
                ultimately sacrifices usability, making information difficult to find and read.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Poor contrast, text lacks emphasis against noisy background, difficult to distinguish key sections. Parts are difficult to read</li>
                <li>Repetition: Fonts, sizes, and colors feel random, inconsistent, with no pattern or theme.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Text blocks and other elements appear to be randomly placed, making it difficult to find specific information.</li>
                <li>Proximity: There is excessive whitespace in the right, and other elements are poorly grouped. Navigation is difficult and not intuitive.</li>
