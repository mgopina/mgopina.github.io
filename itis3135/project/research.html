        <h2>Research Experience</h2>

        <section>
        <p>
            Since 2024, I have served as a research volunteer in the <strong>Biodynamics Lab</strong> at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of musculoskeletal and performance physiology while allowing me to work directly with Division I student-athletes and graduate-level researchers.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this role, I supported a range of biomechanical research activities, with a focus on ultrasound imaging to evaluate muscle and tendon structures. By assisting with the collection of high-quality data, I contributed to ongoing studies aimed at improving athletic performance, injury prevention, and rehabilitation protocols.
        </p>

        <p>
            Key responsibilities and skills gained include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Assisting with the setup, calibration, and operation of ultrasound imaging equipment</li>
            <li>Collaborating with graduate students during live data collection sessions</li>
            <li>Maintaining proper documentation and organization of collected data</li>
            <li>Developing familiarity with human biomechanics and soft tissue imaging</li>
            <li>Practicing strict adherence to research ethics and confidentiality standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This opportunity has not only strengthened my technical and teamwork skills but has also sparked a deeper interest in clinical research and its impact on sports medicine and rehabilitation science.
