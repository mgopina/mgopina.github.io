        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p> I, Mila Gopinathan agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 ITIS 3135-91 Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
        <p>Signed: <em>Mila Gopinathan, 3 February 2025</em></p>
